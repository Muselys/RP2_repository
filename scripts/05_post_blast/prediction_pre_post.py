ðŸ“„ 2. How to present predictions_pre_post.tsv
This file lists per-query changes in predictions. For the report:
Donâ€™t dump the whole file (itâ€™s huge).
Instead, summarise:
# of queries where prediction changed preâ†’post (and whether they got better or just shifted errors).
Examples: include a small table (5â€“10 rows) showing a few interesting cases where the filter fixed a misclassification or where errors persisted.
If the changes are rare (like in your snippet), thatâ€™s an important result: filtering didnâ€™t substantially change predictions. Thatâ€™s a strong, clear point.
ðŸ‘‰ Example table for report (manually trimmed):
qseqid	gene_name	true_species	pred_pre	pred_post
133280_0_51	smc_1	Streptococcus_agalactiae	Staphylococcus_aureus	Staphylococcus_aureus
